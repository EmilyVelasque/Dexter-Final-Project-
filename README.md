# Dexter-Final-Project-
Dexter, a popular show from 2006 directed by James Manos Jr., follows Dexter Morgan, a serial killer who targets those he deems deserve death. But, there has been no investigation into how using his inner monologue to drive the plot affects storytelling, especially from a film perspective. Therefore, a study was conducted to explore this.

**Instructions**

To utilize the script, open the "STA215-Velasquez.R" file that contains my code for these findings.

**Methods**

The analysis focused on two variables, the number of characters and Dexter’s inner thoughts per scene. The population of the study consisted of scenes from season one of Dexter on Netflix, and purposeful sampling was used to select episodes 1, 4, 7, 10, and 11. The unit of analysis was defined as scenes, with a new scene beginning whenever the location changed. For example, a transition from Dexter being in a car to being at his home would indicate a scene change. In total, 147 observations were analyzed to ensure diversity in the narrative.

**Operationalization**

All variables were operationalized, meaning they were denied and measured in a way that could be tested. The first variable examined was the number of main characters in each scene. This included any scenes with characters such as Dexter Morgan, Debra Morgan, Angel Batista, Joey Quinn, Astor Bennett, Harry Morgan, Vince Masuka, Maria LaGuerta, Rita Bennett, Brian Moser, and or Thomas Matthews, all of whom were counted.

The second variable examined was Dexter’s inner thoughts in each scene,  operationalized as any instance where Dexter’s inner thoughts were audible to the audience.
